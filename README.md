# Quora Question Pair Similarity Prediction.

## Problem Statement
* Quora is a place to gain and share knowledge—about anything. It’s a platform to ask questions and connect with people who contribute unique insights and quality answers. 
* Over million of people visit Quora , so it's no surprise that many people ask similarly worded questions. Multiple questions with the same intent can cause seekers to spend more time finding the best answer to their question, and make writers feel they need to answer multiple versions of the same question.
* Therefore to tackle this NLP problem , we will implement some advance techniques to identify whether question pairs are duplicates or not.
